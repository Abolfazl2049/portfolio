Hey Everyone on my journey to learn and master WebRTC for video & audio communication , honestly i couldnt find a solid source to explain how WebRTC actually works and how to use it, espacially about multy WebRTC connection 😑 but here is the good news ! so i created a starter-minimalist template for anyone who wants to start using WebRTC for multy video & audio communication . this starter project contains two main part ,frontend & backend. backend handles the signaling for wbertc and frontend do the rest. the backend has been done with express js. the frontend part has been written in Vue.js. make sure you follow the guides in the repo README. if you have any question about the repo feel free to ask. hope this helps my repo : [link](https://github.com/Abolfazl2049/multi-connection-webrtc-starter)
