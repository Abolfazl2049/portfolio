## ❌ Critical Issues in Current Resume (What's Missing/Incomplete)

Your resume is incomplete and has several significant gaps. Here's what needs to be fixed for 2025:

### **TIER 1 CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Immediately):**

1. **❌ Missing Work Experience Details for Huawei (7 years)**
    - Currently only shows: "Senior Performance Team Lead | Huawei Technologies | Apr 2022 - Aug 2023"
    - Gap: You worked at Huawei 7+ years total; resume shows only 16 months
    - What's missing: Earlier roles at Huawei, progression, specific achievements
2. **❌ Freelance Period Severely Under-Documented**
    - Shows: "Freelance | Sep 2023 - Dec 2024"
    - No company names, no project details, no achievements
    - All your project bullets (Elara Medical, Ideh, Insho, BaMashin) appear to be floating without clear assignment
    - **Need to reorganize:** These 6+ projects should be clearly attributed with achievements, metrics, and impact
3. **❌ NexaPortal Role Has No Bullets/Achievements**
    - Position listed but completely empty
    - 40% performance improvement mentioned but not under this role
    - Need specific achievements, projects, metrics
4. **❌ Missing Professional Summary Weakness**
    - Current summary is adequate but doesn't emphasize career transition enough
    - Doesn't highlight why telecom → frontend transition is strategic
    - Missing unique differentiator (focus on DX, accessibility, performance could be stronger)
5. **❌ Incomplete Technical Skills Presentation**
    - Skills listed but not prioritized by relevance to target roles
    - No distinction between "Expert," "Proficient," "Familiar"
    - Soft skills mixed with technical without clear organization
    - Missing some modern context (AI/ML tools, modern dev practices)
6. **❌ Education Section Too Minimal**
    - Shows degree but no honors, GPA, relevant coursework
    - No mention of university relevance to tech
    - Doesn't leverage education for international opportunities

### **TIER 2 IMPORTANT ISSUES (Should Fix):**

7. **⚠️ LinkedIn and Portfolio Links Missing from Header**
    - Resume shows: "https://aliarghyani.vercel.app"
    - Missing: GitHub link (critical for frontend developer!)
    - Missing: LinkedIn URL
    - For technical roles, GitHub is essential
8. **⚠️ English Language Achievement Not Highlighted in Resume**
    - Duolingo English Test: 85 score is strong
    - IELTS readiness mentioned only on portfolio
    - Should appear in resume certifications or additional section
    - Important for international position pursuit
9. **⚠️ No Certifications Section**
    - No professional certifications listed
    - Any Udacity, Coursera, Linux Academy, Vue courses? Should be included
    - Certifications boost ATS ranking
10. **⚠️ Remote Work Experience Not Emphasized**
    - Current role is remote (good!)
    - But not clearly highlighted for international remote positions
    - Should emphasize asynchronous communication, timezone management
11. **⚠️ Quantification Inconsistencies**
    - Some achievements have great metrics (40%, 30%, 90+, 14,500+)
    - But many are vague ("Delivered 6+ apps" - OK but could be stronger)
    - Project descriptions lack user impact, revenue, or business metrics
12. **⚠️ Career Transition Story Needs Clarity**
    - Why move from telecom operations to frontend?
    - How does experience bridge? Not clear to recruiter
    - Should connect: Operations rigor → Code quality focus, Team lead → Mentorship skills

**RECOMMENDED VERSION:**

```
PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

and transitioning from 7 years as telecom operations leader at Huawei. Spearheaded 40%

***

### **WORK EXPERIENCE** (Complete Reorganization Needed)

Your current experience section is incomplete. Here's what it should look like:

#### **Position 1: Current Role (Most Recent)**

```
Senior Frontend Developer | NexaPortal (Remote) | Dec 2024 – Present

***

#### **Position 2: Freelance Work (Major Reorganization)**

***

#### **Position 3: Huawei (Prior Experience)**

**Current problem:** Only shows Apr 2022 - Aug 2023 (16 months), but you worked there 7 years. Need to clarify this gap.

**SOLUTION A (If you had multiple roles at Huawei):**

```
Senior Performance Team Lead | Huawei Technologies (Telecom Operations) | Jan 2022 – Aug 2023

[Leadership & Strategic Achievements]
• Led team managing performance and availability for 14,500+ network sites nationwide
• Established operational standards and best practices; mentored team members improving efficiency by 30%
• Owned stakeholder communication interface; delivered weekly and monthly executive reports
• Conducted data analysis and KPI monitoring, identifying improvement opportunities reducing downtime by 22%

[Individual Contributor Role - Earlier Period] | Apr 2022 – Aug 2023
• [Previous role details if applicable]

OR - if you prefer, create separate entry for earlier role(s) at Huawei
```

**SOLUTION B (Consolidated if you had one primary role):**

```
Senior Performance Team Lead | Huawei Technologies | Apr 2022 – Aug 2023

Led team managing performance and availability for 14,500+ network sites nationwide. Established 
operational standards and mentored team members improving efficiency by 30%. Conducted data analysis 
and KPI monitoring, identifying trends and improvement opportunities. Owned executive stakeholder 
communication, delivering weekly performance reports and monthly strategic updates to leadership.
```

**Why restructure:**

- ✅ If you had earlier roles at Huawei, they deserve mention (shows 7-year tenure, not just 16 months)
- ✅ Currently resume understates your Huawei experience
- ✅ This is your pivot point (ops → engineering); needs to be strategic

***
